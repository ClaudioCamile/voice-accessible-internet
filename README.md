# voice accessiblity for the internet


One of the things that excites me the most and makes me passionate about is dealing with the endless realms of voice recognition specs, researches, learning, coding, etc'... It can be said that this is just the tip of the iceberg, I know things are not really new , and many friends everywhere have done wonderful things long before That I "hatched the egg," but I just admit it's a simple fascinating tool. 

Now let's leave for a second the big money of security and identification, smart homes, court detention facilities and more - countless applications.
Let's take a moment and stop out of the financial maraton and the constant running after money, okay? A person who has a billion in it's bank - and knows that in another ten minutes he is going to die, will give his entire billion for some more few minutes of breathing unless he or she is very unconnected to itself at all.

Things are clear, known and simple. Thank God we all see, taste and hear fine, but quietly, without making "unnecessary" noise, there are many, many of us that for them it's a whole different story, a whole different world, their encounter with a world very different from ours - a completely different experience, and I say the words very gently and carefully.

Most of us prefer to close our eyes, shat down our ears and move our faces aside in order to divide ourselves from them rather than experience with them and from a large destance away their pain, what they feall, how they taste ther lifes, are they a lone? don't we too!

The result is for most of us is that they are the "transparent people" - so we call them in our minds, that's in order to feal better with our selfs, but the trufh is that they are also friends in the same univarce as we do, to the same place which we are belong, under the same sky,

But for us - they are "less", and why? because we are the best, and thay are only the rest, so, of thay are the fucked up ones... yep.

In my current project I'm trying to break my iced hart and I write, looking for, and hopfully will find, a way to make my transparent brothers and sisters more accessible web, it's so trivial for us but almost inconceivable for "them", and since I'm only one person who has acquired very limited information in his life, the project I write now very limited, there for I invite all mankind with no diffrietnt race, religion or sex to join me, lift the "glove" and promote - in the way of each and every one - this idea.

I have no idea how much each of us has been exposed to the truth about human behavior in ancient societies, but from what I remember learning - here and there during life - whoever was a "burden" on society,  was thrown over the cliff into the abyss, hundreds and thousands of years later - in our present - It's much easier for all of us to do the exact same thing today, but we can strive and try - as a human being - to be better, to have an compassion feeling for ourselves & others. it allways start from small things.


I say It's time to change, who will join me ?!
Everyone are welcome to join! The power belong to the dreamers....
